                                LeBron James' statistics indicate that he is a much better overall basketball player. 
                                While Jordan scored more overall, LeBron is a more efficient player, shooting better 
                                from two and three-point range. LeBron is also a much better passer and rebounder than Jordan ever was.
                            </p>
